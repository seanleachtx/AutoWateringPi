# AutoWateringPi
Using a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with moisture sensors to automatically water plants.
Currently working on getting the sensors reading input.

Long-Term Plans(In No Specific Order):
Add connectivity to remote SQL Server
Encapsulate project in docker with detailed instructions on the hardware side
Run the program as a cronjob every minute or so
Limit hardcode
Draw diagrams for those looking into the project to better understand
Allow functionality to open solenoid valve for a predetermined period of time for watering

Lofty Goals:
Apply machine learning in conjunction with data analytics to determine the period of time in which to water dynamically over time to maximize growth.
